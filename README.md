# ChemLib
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Glease/ChemLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Glease/ChemLib)
A simple ChemLib. Currently ~~only data structure~~many functions are all implemented. Check it
 out!

## Capabilities

- Data structure of basic chemistry concepts(basic isn't that basic. think of rocks you have went 
through during college all have some sort of name telling you it's just about basis or is a 
introduction)
- XML encoding form.
- Extensive plugin architecture.
- Scoping mechanism to support multiple database to live and work together happily. 

## Status

- [x] XML Schema
- [ ] Unit tests (I need to hire someone else to do this... I never got to know this kind of stuff)
- [x] Sample CDB-Simple
- [x] basic CDB-Simple
- [x] general CDB-Simple
- [ ] advanced CDB-Simple 
- [x] ~~data validation~~normalization
- [x] function evaluation (done, but not yet integrated)

## Way to complex
There is a plan to make this lib a complex, generic chemistry library, but it would take years 
before I could even got a working prototype. So I build a simple one now.
