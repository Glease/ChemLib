# ChemLib
A simple ChemLib. Currently only data access is implemented.

## Status

- [x] XML Schema
- [x] JAXB stuff
- [ ] Unit tests (I need to hire someone else to do this... I never got to know this kind of stuff)
- [x] Sample CDB-Simple
- [ ] basic CDB-Simple
- [ ] general CDB-Simple
- [ ] advanced CDB-Simple 
- [ ] data validation
- [ ] function evaluation (working on it)

## Way to complex
There is a plan to make this lib a complex, generic chemistry library, but it would take years before I could even got a working prototype. So I build a simple one now.
